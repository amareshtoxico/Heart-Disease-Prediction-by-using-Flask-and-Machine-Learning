# Machine_Learning

Model Development and Deployment Description:
This project involved developing, training, and deploying a suite of major machine learning classification models to predict the presence of heart disease based on the features in the provided heart.csv dataset.

🎯 Objectives

Build a robust predictive model for heart disease diagnosis.

Compare performance of different Machine Learning algorithms.

Deploy the model using Flask for an interactive web application
